                        <br>
                        <h2>I created this poster for a class assignment. The brief was to design a 24” × 36” digital
                            poster about either 1) your life under COVID 19 or 2) how you see the future of design
                            without using software explicitly intended for design. This poster was created inspired by
                            COVID isolation throughout the pandemic and how so much of my socialization was through
                            screens and layers of separation. I tackled themes of loneliness and isolation despite
                            digital connectivity for this poster, and incorporated another layer to it as well using
                            unothodox design tools. I created the poster using a pattern making software clled Stitch
                            Fiddle. During the pandemic, since there was a lot of isolation, I spent a lot of time
                            crocheting, so I chose this tool as an homage to that aspect of the pandemic.</h2>

                            assignment, we had to research and learn a skill and consider how it would tie into our
                            design practice. I chose to learn to knit, as it always seem daunting and out of my comfort
                            zone as a crocheter. I learned about other designers using this skill in their work and
                            found it inspiring, and I enoyed learning this skill and look forward to seeing what I can
                            do with it in the future. I created the publications in Adobe InDesign and Illustrator. I
                            also had to print and bind the zine series which was a very educational experience. </h2>
