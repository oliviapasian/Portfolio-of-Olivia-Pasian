                            illustrate the proverb "fish out of water", meaning someone who is in a situation they are
                            unsuited to. I chose to represent this as a nervous hang-glider who is not as suited to
                            flying as the birds around them. Created using the app Procreate.</h2>

                            chose to represent the proverb as a pirate and mermaid being friends. I interpreted it as
                            two friends doing a pinky promise to add to the secretive part of the proverb and show they
                            are close, and one is a pirate to kind of allude to the thieves part. Created using the app

                        <h2>I created this illustration for a class assignment where we were asked to design a mural for
                            a BIA. This is my final mural for the Entertainment District in Toronto. I wanted to include
                            some of the popular landmarks of the area since it has a lot of tourist attractions so I
                            focused on the aquarium and within the tank there are buildings like the CN Tower and Rogers
                            Centre. There are people looking into the glass to offer some depth and perspective and I
                            chose to do warm colours for the fish to make them pop against the cooler background and put
                            them in the front. The effect of the scene is kind of like an underwater Toronto area with
                            fish people. I think it is kind of silly and fun with the concept and bright colours and I
                            think it would be a really cool addition to the BIA as it encapsulates the overall vibe.
