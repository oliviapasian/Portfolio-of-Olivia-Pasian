                        <h2><b><i>Origins of the Printing Press, 2022</i></b></h2>
                        <br>
                        <h2>This illustration was completed for a class assignment. The brief was to create a 1 minute
                            video where the
                            information is related to time, such as a historical timeline or a study of plants or
                            animals over time. For this
                            assignment, I chose to focus on the origins of
                            the printing press and their relevance today. I created a
                            timeline of significant printing inventions and added text
                            animations to highlight key pieces of information. I also
                            added transition animations and illustrated animations
                            to make my video more engaging and to illustrate some
                            of the inventions for visualization. My concept was to
                            create my timeline in a notebook setting to create a more
                            storytelling feel and make it more fun. My goal was to
                            create an informative, engaging video about the origins of
                            the printing press, and I feel that my final video fulfilled the
                            goals of the assignment and my own goals. Created using Adobe After Effects, Procreate, and
                            Illustrator.</h2>

                        <h2>For the assignment, we also had to submit a <b>process file</b>, which you can find linked
                            <a href="process-files/Motion Process Book Olivia Pasian  (1).pdf" target="_blank"
                                class="link"> <b> HERE</b></a>. Some of it may not make sense out of context but it
                            focuses on my process through this project.</h2>
