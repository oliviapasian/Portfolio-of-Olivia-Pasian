    Though much of this website is built off of skills I learned in classes I have taken, I also did some research for a few new techniques.
        1. Polka Dot Background: https://dev.to/clairecodes/how-to-create-a-polka-dot-background-with-css-23m0 
        I changed the dimensions, colours, and style, but learned about radial-gradient and background-position from here. 

        2. Responsive Hover Image Grid: https://codeconvey.com/responsive-image-grid-with-hover-effects/
        I customized this but I learned about the structure from this website.

        3. Nav bar: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_horizontal.asp
        I always use this tutorial to make a nav bar, I followed their template and customized it to my website!

        4. Scroll to new div on slick: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18071046/smooth-scroll-to-specific-div-on-click
        I followed the idea from the first commenter on this thread to use jQuery to scroll to a different div on a button click. I used this for the arrow in the intro.

        5. Custom scrollbar: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_custom_scrollbar.asp
