                        <h2>This interactive colour experience was created for a class. The brief was to create an
                            interactive visualization that presents insights from a dataset to help answer a question
                            about the particular subject/theme/content. I chose to use the MET museumâ€™s public API to
                            gather images of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings and turned them into an
                            interactive comparative colour analysis website. The goal of the website was to learn more
                            about the similarities and differences of the two art movements with a focus on colour, as
                            colour is significant in both. By offering a variety of relevant filters and scroll effects,
                            I wanted viewers to be able to explore the website and its interactions to be able to
                            compare the data and learn more about the two art movements. I think I created a functional,
                            responsive design to meet my goals and the goals of the assignment, and created an
                            educational tool about art history.</h2>
                        <br>
                        <h2>For the assignment, we also had to submit a <b>process file</b>, which you can find linked

                                target="_blank" class="link"> <b> HERE</b></a>. Some of it may not make sense out of
                            context but it focuses on my process through this project.</h2>
